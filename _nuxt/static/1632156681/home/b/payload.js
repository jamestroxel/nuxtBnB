Close to downtown and a few blocks from Sanders Beach which was really nice. A few minor notes—the neighbor is an early riser and started mowing the lawn right next to our bedroom windows at 7:30am. I also thought it was weird that we had to empty the dishwasher and take out all of the garbage before we checked out at 10am. I normally load and run the dishwasher before I leave but was unable to do so since the dishwasher had to be emptied and everything in it’s originally place. It’s minor but since the cleaning fee is more then I paid my maid for deep cleaning I would have thought I could load the dishwasher and run it and wouldn’t have to take the garbage out. Otherwise cute house, good neighborhood, clean, and comfy.",objectID:"b2"},{homeId:a,reviewer:{image:"https:\u002F\u002Fimages.unsplash.com\u002Fphoto-1487412720507-e7ab37603c6f?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=facearea&facepad=1.9&w=100&h=100",name:"Danielle"},rating:c,date:"2020-10-01T00:00:00-0400",comment:"The home is spacious and comfortable, in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood.
